                <h3>Viewing Data</h3>

                <h4>Race, Gender, and Age</h4>

                <p>By default, a bar graph consisting of the entire city demographics will be displayed. As Districts and communities are selected, charts will appear allowing the user to compare between city,district, and community level data.</p>
                <p>Each chart consists of a grouping of the major racial demographics organized by age</p>
                <p>Groups are labeled in the following manner:</p>
                <ul><bl>NHW:</bl> Non Hispanic, White</ul>
                <ul><bl>NHB:</bl> Non Hispanic, Black</ul>
                <ul><bl>NHAM:</bl> Non Hispanic, Native Indian/Alakan</ul>
                <ul><bl>NHAS:</bl> Non Hispanic, Asian</ul>
                <ul><bl>HISP:</bl> Hispanic/Latino</ul>
                <ul><bl>MULTI:</bl> Multiracial</ul>
                <ul><bl>OTHER:</bl> Other</ul>

                <h4>View by Gender</h4>

                <p>The user may choose which gender to look at simply by clicking the "Change Gender" Button. By default, all charts start at the combined level data, switching to Men, and then Women respectively</p>

                <h3>Trends</h3>
                <p>The most obvious trends one can see are just how segregated the city of chicago is by race. The most obvious example of this would be South Side Chicago district vs Far North Side Chicago district, where the populations of White and African Americans clearly mirror each other. Further more, specific demographics tend to dominate certain communities over others. This can be seem in places like LakeView, which has a high concentration of young, mid 20s to early 30s, white residents. </p>
                <h3>Data</h3>

                <p>This project used race, gender, and age data from the 2010 US Census, as found <a href="http://robparal.blogspot.com/2012/05/hard-to-find-census-data-on-chicago.html">here</a>. In an effort to present it in a more concise manner, age groups were collapsed into ranges of 10 years</p>
