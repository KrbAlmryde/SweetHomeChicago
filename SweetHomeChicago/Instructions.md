Sweet Home Chicago



Installation:
=============
To the best of my understanding (I am new at this web development thing), you need only have a modern Web browser, such as [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/#brand=CHMB&utm_campaign=en&utm_source=en-ha-na-us-sk&utm_medium=ha), [Mozilla FireFox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/), or [Apple Safari](https://www.apple.com/safari/) in order to utilize this application.

This application is driver by the mouse. As such, in order to interact with it in any way, you will need a working mouse. You can find them cheap online or at your local computer store.

NOTE:
-----
Before we go any further, a note of caution(!) This application has been designed with a screen resolution of 8196 x 2188 (!) in mind.
Yes, that is a VERY big monitor. So, unless you have the eyes of a hawk, I suggest you make use of the zooming feature of your browser.


Instructions for use:
======================

You may have noticed (depending on what type of screen you are viewing the application on) that the community labels are a little small. Never fear! Simply move your mouse over a community's boundary and the text will enlarge. See what I mean [here](communityHover.jpg)

In order to see population stats about a specific community, simply 'click' on it. 
[Before](communitySelectBefore.jpg) and [after](communitySelectAfter.jpg)

Should you be interested in gleaning information about a specific district, "double click" on one of the labels. [Before](districtSelectedBefore.jpg) and [After](districtSelectedAfter.jpg)
